gameState.detectionLevel = 0;
gameState.biometricScannersDisabled = true;

// Add custom exploitation methods
rooms.accessControlRoom.interactions["quantum hack biometrics"] = {
    response: function() {
        gameState.biometricScannersDisabled = true;
        return "🔮 QUANTUM ENCRYPTION BREACH: Biometric systems compromised!";
    }
};
```
