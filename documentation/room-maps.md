## üéØ Strategic Points of Interest

### Critical Choke Points
1. **Access Control Room**: Only path to vault, requires multiple preparations
2. **Security Office**: Central control point for camera disabling
3. **Executive Office**: Source of vault access card

### Key Intelligence Locations
1. **Maintenance Closet**: Biometric maintenance schedule
2. **Security Office**: Camera passwords and security overrides
3. **IT Department**: Server room codes and admin access
4. **Server Room**: Executive access procedures
5. **Executive Office**: Vault security information

### Optimal Timing Considerations
- **Guard Breaks**: Use "wait" in Security Office when guard leaves
- **Maintenance Windows**: Wednesday biometric maintenance (from schedule)
- **Employee Patterns**: Listen in hallway for guard coffee breaks

---

## üí° Navigation Tips

### Efficient Movement
- Use the map coordinates to plan optimal routes
- Minimize backtracking by completing area objectives before moving on
- Combine social engineering with technical exploits for fastest progress

### Risk Management
- High-detection areas (Security Office, Access Control, Vault) should be approached prepared
- Use security uniform in high-risk areas to reduce detection
- Complete camera disabling before accessing IT Department

### Item Collection Strategy
- Some items are automatically acquired (access card from safe)
- Not all items need to be carried for completion
- Critical path items: ladder, security override, admin badge, master key, access card
