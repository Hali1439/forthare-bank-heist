üéØ Conclusion
The Forthare Bank security assessment reveals a fundamentally flawed security posture with critical vulnerabilities across all security domains. The successful compromise demonstrates the necessity of implementing defense-in-depth strategies and addressing both technical and human factor vulnerabilities.

Key Takeaway: Security is only as strong as its weakest link, and in this case, multiple weak links created a path to complete system compromise.
