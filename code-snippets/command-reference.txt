- Use `hint` when stuck for context-specific advice

### Risk Management
- Always `examine` before `use` to understand consequences
- Use `wait` in Security Office instead of risky interactions
- Wear `security uniform` in high-security areas

### Inventory Management
- Check `inventory` frequently to know what you're carrying
- Some items are automatically added (access card from safe)
- Not all items need to be carried for completion
